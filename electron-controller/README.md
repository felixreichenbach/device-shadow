# NOTES

```npm run dev```


Folloq this guide for complete setup: https://dev.to/mandiwise/electron-apps-made-easy-with-create-react-app-and-electron-forge-560e


electron.js -> main.js // considered more intuitive naming but the same

ICON -> see further down in the guid how to make it skipped for the moment

electron-is-dev needs to be installed not as decdependency!


Package app:

```npm run make```


## Create Application

Success! Created react-controller at /Users/felixreichenbach/Documents/GitHub/vehicle-shadow/electron-controller/react-controller
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-controller
  npm start

Happy hacking!
